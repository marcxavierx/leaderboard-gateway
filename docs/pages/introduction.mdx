This guide will walk you through deploying your own secure leaderboard gateway.

## Why This Gateway?

This gateway protects your casino API by:
- Keeping your casino API URL completely private
- Only exposing usernames and wager amounts (everything else is blocked)
- Requiring an API key that only you control
- Allowing you to revoke access anytime

**You stay in complete control** - the gateway runs under your own Zuplo account.

## Step 1: Deploy to Zuplo

### Option A: Import from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Go to [portal.zuplo.com](https://portal.zuplo.com) and login/signup
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Import from GitHub"**
4. Paste your repository URL
5. Click **"Import"**
6. Click **"Deploy"**

Your gateway will be live at: `https://[your-project-name].zuplo.app`

### Option B: Upload Directly

1. Download this project as a ZIP file
2. Go to [portal.zuplo.com](https://portal.zuplo.com) and login/signup
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select **"Upload ZIP"**
5. Upload the ZIP file
6. Click **"Deploy"**

---

## Step 2: Configure Your Casino API

1. In your Zuplo project, click **"Settings"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Environment Variables"**
3. Click **"Add Variable"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name:** `CASINO_URL`
   - **Value:** Your casino API leaderboard endpoint

   Example: `https://your-casino-api.com/api/v1/leaderboard`
5. Click **"Save"**

> 🔒 **This URL stays private.** Only you can see it in your environment variables. The leaderboard developer will never see this.

---

## Step 3: Create an API Key

1. Click **"Services"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"API Key Manager"**
3. Click **"Create Consumer"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name:** `Leaderboard Website` (or any name you want)
   - Leave other settings as default
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **Copy the API key** that appears - you'll need to give this to your leaderboard developer

> 💡 **Tip:** You can create multiple API keys if needed, and delete them individually to revoke access.

---

## Step 4: Test Your Gateway

### Test in Browser (Quick Check)

Copy your API key and try this URL in your browser:

```
https://[your-project-name].zuplo.app/leaderboard?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

You should see a JSON response with only usernames and wagers.

### Test with curl (Advanced)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  https://[your-project-name].zuplo.app/leaderboard
```

Expected response:
```json
[
  {
    "username": "Player1",
    "wager": 1200
  },
  {
    "username": "Player2",
    "wager": 950
  }
]
```

### Verify Protection Works

Try accessing without an API key:
```
https://[your-project-name].zuplo.app/leaderboard
```

You should get an error - this confirms your gateway is protected.

---

## Step 5: Give Access to Your Leaderboard Developer

Share with your developer:

1. **Gateway URL:** `https://[your-project-name].zuplo.app/leaderboard`
2. **API Key:** The key you created in Step 3

**What you're NOT sharing:**
- ❌ Your casino API URL (stays in your environment variables)
- ❌ Your casino API credentials
- ❌ Your Zuplo account access
- ❌ Any sensitive data

**What they'll receive:**
- ✅ Only usernames and wager amounts
- ✅ Nothing else

---

## Security Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- ✅ Gateway is deployed under **your** Zuplo account
- ✅ `CASINO_URL` is set in environment variables
- ✅ Test request returns only username and wager fields
- ✅ Request without API key is rejected
- ✅ API key is copied and ready to share

---

## Managing Access

### View Request Logs
1. Go to your Zuplo dashboard
2. Click **"Analytics"**
3. See all requests, response times, and any errors

### Revoke Access
If you need to revoke access to your leaderboard:

1. Go to **Services** → **API Key Manager**
2. Find the consumer (e.g., "Leaderboard Website")
3. Click **"Delete"**

The leaderboard will immediately stop working.

### Create New API Key
1. Follow Step 3 again to create a new consumer
2. Copy the new API key
3. Share it with your developer to restore access

### Update Casino API URL
If your casino API endpoint changes:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Click on `CASINO_URL`
3. Update the value
4. Click **"Save"**

Changes take effect immediately - no need to redeploy.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" Error
**Problem:** Requests return 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:**
- Verify the API key is correct
- Make sure it's included in the request header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY`

### "Internal Server Error"
**Problem:** Requests return 500 error

**Solution:**
- Check that `CASINO_URL` is set correctly in environment variables
- Verify your casino API is responding (test it directly)
- Check Zuplo logs in Analytics section for details

### Empty Response
**Problem:** Returns `[]` even though leaderboard has data

**Solution:**
- Your casino API might use different field names
- The gateway looks for: `username/user/player/name` and `wager/bet/amount/value`
- Contact your developer to adjust the field patterns if needed

---

## What Happens Next?

Once setup is complete:

1. Your leaderboard developer integrates the gateway URL and API key
2. Their website fetches data from **your gateway** (not your casino API)
3. The gateway automatically sanitizes all responses
4. Only usernames and wagers are shown on the leaderboard
5. You can monitor all activity in your Zuplo dashboard

Your casino API stays completely private and protected.
